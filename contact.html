        <p class="contact-overview-text">Contacting your representatives and Congress is a great way to actively raise awareness about an issue and show your support. Everyone in the US has an assigned representative for their congressional area who is dedicated to fighting for their constituents, so it is important to use this resource and make sure that they are acurately representing you! When contacting your representatives it is important to be specific. Introduce yourself and the legislation that you are encouraging them to support or not to support. Saying that you just want them to support climate justice is not as helpful. Make sure to also talk about how it will affect you personally, maybe you are scared to drink your tap water, or you've noticed your favorite swimming hole being filled with trash. It's their job to listen to you! Finally, finish it off by restating the action you want them to take. You can find resources here to locate your representatives, find out how to contact them, and their current stances on climate change. 
          Also if you can, remember to <a href="https://vote.gov/" target="_blank"><button class="contact-button5" href="https://vote.gov/">VOTE</button></a>, not just in federal elections, but also state elections! Be sure to research each candidate before voting. </p>
